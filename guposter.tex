    Or anything else that you don't want to display in a two-column format.

\block{A block}{

    Each block can contain:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item text
        \item lists, like this one
        \item \sout{tables} actually, for some reason that doesn't work
        \item images, like the one in the block below
    \end{itemize}
}

\block{Another block with an image}{
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/logo}
    \end{center}
}

\block{A block with sub-blocks}{
    Each block can contain however many inner blocks.

    \innerblock{An inner block}{
        This is the first inner block.
    }

    \innerblock{Another inner block}{
        This is the second and last inner block.
    }
}

\block{}{
    Blocks don't necessarily always have a title.

\block{A block with a blue frame}{

    This template is largely based on the SINTEF poster template (see \texttt{www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sintef-poster/hksprrptfntf}).
